#AgentSeal

AgentSeal is an agent-based model simulating movement of adult harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) outside their breeding and moutling season. Developed by @MagdaChu.

An updated version of AgentSeal ([AgentSeal_with_GreySeals](https://github.com/KaraWatts/AgentSeal_with_GreySeals/tree/master/AgentSeal_with_GreySeals)) allows you to simulate adult harbour seals and adult grey seals simultaniously over a grey seal habitat map.
